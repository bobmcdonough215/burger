# mySQLBurger

## Concept

In this app, the user can create a list of new burgers, add them to a list of burgers to be devoured, and after they have been devoured moved to the trash. This is handled with GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. When a user adds a new burger, it is added to the mySQL database, and when the user deletes a burger, it is deleted from the database.
